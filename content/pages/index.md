      Hi. I'm Carrie Sanders McKeehan.

      I love my hometown of Louisville and I have had a heart for serving our

      community for decades. I'm a mom to a teenage son, and a passionate,

      special education teacher with [Breckinridge Metropolitan High
      School](https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/schools/profiles/breckinridge-metropolitan-high)
      in Jefferson County Public Schools.
