      Hi. I'm Carrie Sanders McKeehan.

      I love my hometown of Louisville and I have had a heart for serving our

      community for decades.


      This election cycle is more important than ever. With strong momentum for
      Republicans going into the 2022 midterm season, this could be our chance
      to flip this district to Red!
