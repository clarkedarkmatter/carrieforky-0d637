      Hi. I'm Carrie Sanders McKeehan.

      I love my hometown of Louisville and I have had a heart for serving our

      community for decades.


      This election cycle is more important than ever and with strong momentum
      for Republicans going into the 2022 midterm season, this could be our
      chance to FINALLY flip this district.
