      #### “When you vote for Carrie, this is who she is. She is courageous to
      be embarking in this line of work. But I believe in her conviction and if
      she is elected, she will be taking the time to get to know you. She is
      approachable and has an empathetic ear. And she will do all she can to get
      things done in her electorate. When I say what you see is what you get,
      this is who you are getting."
