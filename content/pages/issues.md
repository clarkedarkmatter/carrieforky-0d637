    title: 'Carrie Cares About Solving Our Biggest Problems, Sooner!'
    items:
      - question: What about spending and inflation?
        answer: >
          Carrie will fight for lower business taxes and lower gas taxes -
          especially in this period of rapid inflation. She will fight for
          lowering state income tax and pledge to vote against all tax
          increases.


          Carrie will support any legislation that will bring good

          jobs to the 41st District.
      - question: What's an issue Carrie thinks we can all rally behind?
        answer: >
          Reading is an essential life skill. Literacy should be the top
          priority for all elementary schools and Carrie will ensure that it is
          as your State Representative. 


          Studies suggest that If your child cannot read by the 3rd grade, it
          gets substantially harder for them to be successful in reading later
          on in life. We need more focus on literacy, earlier in the
          developmental cycle to help our students be more successful.
      - question: How can we better protect our students?
        answer: >
          We need student resource officers (SRO's) returned to the schools in
          our district as soon as legislatively possible.


          Our children are too important to be left unprotected.
      - question: How does Carrie feel about education reform?
        answer: >
          Students and parents should have the ability to choose what
          environment

          and curriculum is conducive for each child’s needs and future goals.



          Being for school choice doesn’t mean that I’m against public schools,
          it

          just means not all students thrive in public schools. Alternative
          options should

          be available to those students.
