    title: 'Carrie Cares About Solving Our Biggest Problems, Sooner!'

          Literacy should be the top priority for all schools and I will ensure
          that it is as your State Representative.
           Studies suggest that If your child cannot read by the 3rd grade, it 
          gets substantially harder for them to be successful in reading. I’m
          also
           for safer schools and putting SRO's back in the district, equipping 
          each to handle the rising problems and behavior incidences occurring 

          weekly.


          I’m for school choice.
           Students and parents should have the ability to choose what environment
           and curriculum is conducive for each child’s needs and future goals. 
          Being for school choice doesn’t mean that I’m against public schools,
          it
           just means not all students thrive in public schools and options should
           be available to all students regardless of their social economic 
          backgrounds.

      - question: How do you feel about mandatory vaccinations?
        answer: >
          While I encourage all to get the vaccine if they are able, I will
          always fight for the freedom to say 'No' to a vaccine.


          I’m the only candidate for medical freedom.


          I don’t believe governments or businesses should make medical
          decisions that affect you or your family in any way, shape, or form. 
          I don't agree that someone should lose their job due to their COVID-19
          vaccination status.
