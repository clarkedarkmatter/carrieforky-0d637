          I’m the only candidate for medical freedom.


          I don’t believe governments or businesses should make medical
          decisions

          that affect you or your family in any way, shape, or form. The
          pandemic

          opened my eyes to the corruption around me. I didn’t agree with the 

          Mandates and saw how our liberties and rights were being stripped
          away 

          right before our own very eyes.

      - question: How do you feel about vaccinations?
        answer: >
          While I encourage all to get the vaccine if they are able, I’m the
          only candidate for medical freedom.


          I don’t believe governments or businesses should make medical
          decisions that affect you or your family in any way, shape, or form. 
          I don't agree that someone should lose their job due to their COVID-19
          vaccination status.
