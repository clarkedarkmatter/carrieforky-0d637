    title: 'Carrie Cares About Solving Our Biggest Problems, Sooner!'
    items:
      - answer: >
          **Investing In Literacy**: Reading is an essential life skill.
          Literacy should be the top priority for all schools and Carrie will
          ensure that it is as your State Representative. Studies suggest that
          If your child cannot read by the 3rd grade, it gets substantially
          harder for them to be successful in reading later on in life. We need
          more focus on literacy, earlier in the developmental cycle to help our
          students be more successful.


          **School Safety**: We need more student resource officers (SRO's) back
          in our district. Our children's lives are too important to be left to
          chance.


          **School Choice**: Students and parents should have the ability to
          choose what environment

          and curriculum is conducive for each child’s needs and future goals.

          Being for school choice doesn’t mean that I’m against public schools,
          it

          just means not all students thrive in public schools and options
          should

          be available to all students regardless of their social economic

          backgrounds.
        question: How can we improve our education system?
      - question: What's an issue we can all rally behind?

      - question: How do you feel about mandatory vaccinations?
        answer: >
          While I encourage all to get the vaccine if they are able, I will
          always fight for the freedom to say 'No' to a vaccine.


          I’m the only candidate for medical freedom.


          I don’t believe governments or businesses should make medical
          decisions that affect you or your family in any way, shape, or form. 
          I believe in true medical freedom - an employer shouldn't be able to
          force a COVID vaccination as a condition of employment.

      - question: What about spending and inflation?
        answer: >
          We should be very careful about our government spending right now. 


          Carrie will fight for lower business taxes and lower gas taxes -
          especially in this period of rapid inflation. I will fight for
          lowering state income tax and pledge to vote against all tax
          increases. Carrie will support any legislation that will bring good

          jobs to the 41st District.
