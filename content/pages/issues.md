        question: Safer Communities
      - question: A Stronger Economy
        answer: "I will fight for lower business taxes and lower gas taxes.\n I will fight for lowering state income tax and pledge to vote against \nall tax increases. I will support any legislation that will create good \njobs in the 41st District and state wide.\_\n"
      - question: Better Schools
        answer: >
          I will fight for our children to be safer in schools by supporting
          onsite

          School Resource officers and off-duty police officers. I will support 

          school curriculums that will increase literacy success rates across
          the 

          board leading to equality for all students.
      - question: How does Carrie feel about education reform?
        answer: >
          Students and parents should have the ability to choose what
          environment

          and curriculum is conducive for each child’s needs and future goals.



          Being for school choice doesn’t mean that I’m against public schools,
          it

          just means not all students thrive in public schools. Alternative
          options should

          be available to those students.
