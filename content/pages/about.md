          Carrie's passion has always been focused on education. With [Jefferson
          County Public Schools (JCPS)](https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/), I
          work with troubled teens who are removed from the comprehensive
          schools, helping to provide support for their next steps. 


          I also serve as an Associate Principal with Pastor Cecil Blye's “[More
          Grace Christian
          Academy](https://www.trulia.com/schools/KY-louisville-more_grace_christian_academy-5700090973)”,
          an inner city private school. I was hired to help build a curriculum,
          connect the school with the community, build and support a successful
          faculty and develop systems for student success.
