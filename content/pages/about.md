          My passion has been focused primarily on education. With
          [JCPS](https://www.jefferson.kyschools.us/),
           I work with troubled teens who are removed from the comprehensive 
          schools, helping to provide support for their next steps. I also
          serve 

          as an Associate Principal with Pastor Cecil Blye's “[More Grace
          Christian
          Academy](https://www.trulia.com/schools/KY-louisville-more_grace_christian_academy-5700090973)”,
           an inner city private school. I was hired to help build a curriculum, 
          connect the school with the community, build and support a successful 

          faculty and develop systems for student success.
